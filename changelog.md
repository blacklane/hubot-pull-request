# Changelog

## v0.5.0
- `bender pr a` takes now only people into account which are online. 

## v0.4.2
- Try/catch errors
- Add urls to pr listings

## v0.4.1
- Small fixes:
  - Initializing `subscribers` in Hubot brain, so we don't have to do it manually.
  - `Subscriber.findNamesFor` performs a clone of the Hubot brain data - otherwise it would modify the persisted data (not desired).

## v0.4.0
- Added possibility to subscribe some users to a particular Github / Gitlab project. If a Github / Gitlab project has subscribers on Hubot, then pull / merge request assignments will only go to these subscribers. If no subscribers were found for a given project, Hubot will choose from all project collaborators.
  - Triggers:
    - `hubot github|gitlab subscribe <project> <user>`
    - `hubot github|gitlab s <project> <user>`
- Added possibility to unsubscribe a user from a particula Github / Gitlab project:
  - Triggers:
    - `hubot github|gitlab unsubscribe <project> <user>`
    - `hubot github|gitlab uns <project> <user>`
- Added possibility to list all subscribers:
  - Triggers:
    - `hubot github|gitlab subscribers`
    - `hubot github|gitlab sbs`
- Added possibility to store a Hubot user's Github / Gitlab user name. If a Hubot user has a Github / Gitlab user name registered with Hubot, then random pull / merge request assignments will exclude the caller.
  - Triggers:
    - `hubot github|gitlab me <user>`
- Added possibility to display the Github / Gitlab registered user for the calling Hubot user:
  - Triggers:
